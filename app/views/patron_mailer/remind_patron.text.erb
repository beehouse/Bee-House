Beehouse Library 
================

Hey <%= @patron.name.split(' ')[0] %>,

I know you probably just can't stop reading <%= @resource.title %>, on the bus, on the train, in bed, at the dinner table, in the shower with a little ziplock bag around it, but... It's nearing its due date. <% if @loan.renewable? %> You can renew it through the site or get it back to us at Beehouse. Either way, be <% else %> And, unfortunately, you've reached the max number of renewals we allow. Be <% end %> sure to get it returned in time or  we'll have to charge you late fees, which would kinda suck.

Sincerely,
Clay a
