Beehouse Library 
================

Hey <%= @patron.name.split(' ')[0] %>,

Thank you for joining the Beehouse community. We currently have <%= @collection_count %> books in the system, and, if we can count on anything, we'll have more books in the future. Take some time to look through what's there. See if what you're looking for's there, or if anything unexpected catches your eye. 

Feel free to let me know if there's anything I can help you with. This welcome is sent out from my personal email so you can reply directly, no problem.

Cheers,
Clayton Albachten
