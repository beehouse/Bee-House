Beehouse Library 
================

<%= @patron.name.split(' ')[0] %>,

I'm writing to inform you <%= @resource.title %> is overdue. Please return it <% if @loan.renewable? %> (or renew it through the site) <% end %> as soon as possible. For every day the resource is overdue you will be incur an additional 50Â¢ in late fees. Nobody wants that.

Sincerely,
Clayton Albachten
